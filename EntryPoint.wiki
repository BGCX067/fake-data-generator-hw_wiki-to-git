This is the `__main__.py` for the module. Not `__init__.py`, since this is going to be the command line script operations that we almost certainly don't want to have happen on import!

It pretty much imports all the other modules, imports optparse (argparse, if we want 2.7+ only), then hooks them together in order and runs it.

The entry point is not intended to be an importable script.

Approximate order of operation is:
  # ConfigManager
  # PluginEngine (probably including DefaultStuff if no other plugin/s specified)
  # If loading an existing model: ModelSaveLoad, using objects from ModelGenerator
  # Else: ModelGenerator
  # DataGenerator
  # Call into Model object from ModelGenerator to write pretty description of model
  # If asked to save model: ModelSaveLoad

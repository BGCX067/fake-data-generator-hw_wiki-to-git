=Overview=

Since all relations come only from the PluginManager, the tool is useless with at least one plugin. We should think about what default operations we want to support.

=Operations to Support=
==0ary==
  * uniform 0-1
  * Gaussian mean 0.5 stddev 0.125
  * constant 0.5
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub_curve Bathtub curve] 0-1
==1ary==
  * Negative
  * Log transform (because we honestly see that in a lot of our data)
  * Random log transform 25% (yep, we see that one too)
  * cos(2pi `*` x)
==2ary==
  * Four calculator functions
  * XOR-like function (*this is the big important one*)
  * Sum-and-logit transformation
  * Abs difference
==3ary==
==varargs==
  * Sum
  * Average
  * Product
  * Stddev
  * Range
